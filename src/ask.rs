//! `rvn ask`: a question about past agent work, answered from the record with sources.
//!
//! The question's scope is resolved first: the project (or every project), the time it
//! asks about ("yesterday", "on 4 October", read by `when`), and the moment it is asked
//! as of (`before`: a replayed question never sees memories or events from after it).
//!
//! A question about a time window ("what did we do yesterday") is answered from what
//! happened in that window: the memories distilled from sessions active then, ordered by
//! when their events happened, plus the developer's own prompts from those sessions. Any
//! other question gets the memories that best match it (the same hybrid ranking as MCP
//! search) plus the prompts behind them. The model answers from those sources only,
//! citing memories as [#id] and events as [E id]; a citation of something it was not
//! shown is dropped, so every source printed was really in front of it. Each memory says
//! whether the code its session wrote is still there. Without a model, the sources are
//! the answer.

const SYSTEM: &str = r##"You answer a developer's question about their own past work with coding agents,
using only the sources given: memories (notes distilled from their agent sessions, id like #123) and
events (what the developer typed in those sessions, id like E456). Some memories include "asked:", what
the developer typed in that session: the most direct evidence of why something was done.
Rules: answer in 1-8 short sentences or bullets (a question about a time may use more, one per
project or per thing done), plain words, concrete names and values. Cite the sources
you used right after the claim they support, like [#123] or [E456]. State a reason, cause or motive only
when a source states it; never infer one from a later suggestion, follow-up or next step. Say whose
reason it is: when the developer only accepted an option (their "asked:" line is a short go-ahead such
as "ok let's do X", "B", "go"), the reason was the agent's recommendation, so say "the agent
recommended it because ...; you chose it", not "we chose it because ...". A later message from the
developer saying it is still open or undecided outweighs an earlier memory that calls it decided. Give times
as dates (each source shows its date), never only a clock time or "earlier": when something started,
was decided or shipped, say on which date. A source marked "pinned by you" is the developer's own
standing rule or fact: say it is their rule and since when. Keep each source's own
specifics: which system, size, version or number it names. When the question asks about a time
("yesterday", a date), use only sources dated in that window. Over several projects, give one
bullet per project, named, listing its main outcomes by name (those marked "(shipped)" first), so no
project's work is left out or blurred. In one project, list every distinct thing that shipped or
was done, each by name; do not merge separate things into one line. Say "in progress" or "partly done" when the sources do not show it finished; never
call work done or shipped unless a source says so. If a decision is not recorded, say it is not
recorded. If the sources do not answer the question, say so in one sentence instead of guessing; then
cite nothing. Never cite an id that was not given.
